"""Stdio MCP server exposing TypeSafe Jev judgments as typed tools.

The adapter owns only the MCP schema, input validation, transport startup, and the
translation of `CliError` into MCP tool errors. Provider selection, credential lookup,
request translation, and response normalization stay in `jev_cli` and are called
directly; the `jev` CLI is never spawned as a subprocess.
